StarGunner
==========

A simple game made by myself and Cody Prior during our Senior year CSC 165 Game Architecture class. You can 
find instructions on how to play as well as specifics on what major pieces we each worked on, in the User Guide.

Stargunner requires Sac State's custom game engine, known as SAGE. I've included the version of SAGE that was 
used for this game. Stargunner may not currently be working in 1-player mode, as the project was geared towards 
2-player networked play.
