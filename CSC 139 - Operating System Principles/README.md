CSC 139 - OS Principles
======

All assignments are in C++ and this class was taken during my Senior year, Spring 2014. I tried to find 
the assignment descriptions, but they have been taken down. Here is what I can remember 
from those decriptions:

prog1: performing some operations using multi-processing
prog2: performing same operations from prog1, but using multi-threading
prog3: solve producer/consumer problem with semaphores
prog4: solve producer/consumer problem in similar way?
prog5: memory-mapping a file
prog6: server/client message passing (extra credit assignment)
