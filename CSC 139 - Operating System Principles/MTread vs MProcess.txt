For these first 2 assignments, the process of multithreading is much faster than a similar 
multiprocessing approach because there is a lot of overhead required when performing these 
operations using multiprocessing compared to multithreading. In multiprocessing, all the 
stored processing data (PCB) is duplicated for each new process that is created. This is 
where the overheard comes from. Threads can accomplish a task faster, sometimes, because 
they do not need all this data duplicated. They use shared data and rely on the CPU scheduler 
to give them each some time to make progress in their threads. That can be a downside of 
threads, because in a larger application, you may have many threads waiting since only one 
can use the CPU at once. This can be alleviated by using a multiprocessing solution, where 
tasks are executed simultaneously rather than executing a piece here and a piece there, as in 
multithreading. Sometimes the best solution is a mixture of both multiprocessing and multithreading.
