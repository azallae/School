Front-end website upgrade for the ECS Department at Sac State 

======

I took this class during my  Junior year in Spring 2013. It entailed all aspects of 
the Software Development Life Cycle. Our four person group, "Windows 9", was tasked 
with providing a front-end website which improved how users applied for new ECS computing 
accounts, as well as a back-end management system for those accounts. Out of 8 groups, 
ours was the only one to fully complete both tasks.

I was heavily involved in all aspects of documentation and design for both the front-end 
and back-end parts of the project. In terms of programming, we broke up our four person 
group in two teams of two. I was a part of the front-end team and authored most of the 
code additions for the website. I had to learn and use HTML, PHP, and SQL along with using 
Apache for Windows to test and view code change results.
