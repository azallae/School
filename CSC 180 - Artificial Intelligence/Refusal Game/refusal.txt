a. go to bin directory and then the game directory and type 'java Refusal.java' to run
b. I have a very simplistic eval and I tried to implement alpha beta pruning, but not sure if I did that correctly. 
   I was very limitied on time for this project, andI plan to improve the program by the time the tournament starts.
c. I have it searching 6 plies at the moment, and have that hard-coded for the time being. 
   I hope to find a way to let the program figure out the best number of plies during runtime.
d. It is not very string at all. I can kick it's butt right now, but it seems to work correctly without errors for an entire game.
e. Yes, it is crazy how dumb the eval function is. I can't wait to improve it. 
f. I have some ideas for different heuristics, but none have been implemented so far. Those will take shape during improvements.
g. Ironed out all the bugs, to my knowledge.
h. It does seem to try to prolong the game, even when it is futile for it to.
i. It only refuses in one situation; when the opponent only has one move. I did have a random refusal in there,
   but took it out because of the bugs it was inflicting. I will get it working correctly. 
   Not sure if I want to refuse predetermined moves or just 2 out of 3 randomly or something of that nature, 
   to try to throw off other's programs. I'll probably try both ways and choose the one that seems to have better outcomes.
